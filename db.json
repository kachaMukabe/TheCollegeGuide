      "4 tbsp self-raising flour",
      "4 tbsp caster sugar",
      "2 tbsp cocoa powder",
      "1 medium egg",
      "3 tbsp milk",

      ],
    "Steps": [
      "Add the flour, sugar and cocoa powder to the largest mug you have (to stop it overflowing in the microwave) and mix. Add the egg and mix in as much as you can, but don't worry if there's still dry mix left.",
      "Add the milk, oil and essence and mix until smooth, before adding the chocolate chips, nuts, or raisins, if using, and mixing again. Centre your mug in the middle of the microwave oven and cook on high for 1Â½ -2 mins, or until it has stopped rising and is firm to the touch. Don't forget to watch it rise as it cooks!"
